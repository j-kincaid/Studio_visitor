An app to foster meaningful connections between artists and audiences.

This app will complement the experience for attendees of the Charlotte Street Foundation's Open Studios event on April 20, 2019. My project's MVP is to work as a tool to facilitate audience engagement with artists whose work will be on view to the public. It will incorporate artists' profiles and a studio map as well as tools for ongoing outreach and communication with the organization.

Although my web app may not have all of the features I would like to have by the event, the basic foundation of this project can evolve over time and be applied to future event scenarios.

The Charlotte Street Foundation is a non-profit that supports the arts in Kansas City through cash awards, and free studio and performance spaces for artists and creatives to do their work. CSF facilitates opportunities for artists and performers to collaborate with businesses and civic leaders. The organization engages with national and international philanthropic and cultural leaders.

After meeting with CSF Marketing Director, Mason Kilpatrick, I had lots of great suggestions for screen design and have recreated higher-res mocks. Bear in mind, that not all areas will be highlighted at the same time.
